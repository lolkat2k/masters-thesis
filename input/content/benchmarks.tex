\chapter{Validation and Benchmarks}
\label{chap:benchmarks}

The tests are run:
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item Intel Xeon E5-2650 CPU and an NVIDIA GTX 780Ti GPU.
\end{itemize}
%
(The same as for the prototyping).

Two benchmarks from well-established benchmark suites:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Parboil: tpacf
\item Rodinia: kmeans
\end{itemize}
%
and x micro-benchmarks, or unit tests if you will:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item lav et program som beskrevet i problem-statement
  (sort, scan, osv).
\end{itemize}


\section{Validation in Bulk}

Here you present your result. Look only at the results. You
go into detail about the specific benchmarks in their own
sections.

\section{Micro-benchmarks}

Present a select few.


\section{Parboil: tpacf}

Show what the program looked like before and how it looks
like with your construct (code listing). Describe what it
did and what it does now (should be the same). Stress how
your construct is nicer and easier to understand.

Describe why the speedup/slowdown is as it is.


\section{Rodinia: kmeans}

Same as for Parboil.
